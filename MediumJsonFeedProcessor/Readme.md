This is simple to use.
In medium-collect.php, change the "$rss_url = 'https://medium.com/feed/@YOUR_MEDIUM_USERNAME';"
to have your Medium Username in the url. like so: $rss_url = 'https://medium.com/feed/@outbackgames';

This script is helped by RSS2Json. Until the day that service expires, or until I feel like creating a RSS to Json parser. All RSS to Json conversion will be handled by their service.
